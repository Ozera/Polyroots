Polyroots
=========

~Various projects doing various things~


Polyroots will consist of relatively small projects that pertain to whatever I am interested in that day.
I am doing this so as to have a place to store my code/projects publically rather than on the server I
currently use where it is unlikely to get any attention. I hope to better track my skill level in programming
by using Github and I hope to whoever views this will appretiate the work that will come.
